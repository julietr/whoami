# Resources

Here are some external resources I find useful.

## Daily Reads

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* Reddit [r/news](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/), [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/), [r/lgbt](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/)

## Software Development

### Tools

These tools have helped me out immensely throughout my career:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): Code editor and lightweight IDE.
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): Still the best open source relational database.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/): A highly-capable alternative to Windows Notepad.
* [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/): Diffs files and folders.
* [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/tutorials.html) ([Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)): Diagrams, charts, and other visuals. Great for high-level, semi-formal documentation.
* [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/): Diagrams and charts for precise engineering diagrams and data visualizations.

### Architecture and Design

* [.NET Design Patterns](https://dofactory.com/net/design-patterns): Inspired by the original Java "Gang of Four" patterns.
* Martin Fowler's [Online Catalog of Refactorings](https://refactoring.com/catalog/) and [Patterns of Distributed Systems](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/).

### .NET / C#

I highly recommend that programmers of all levels study these repositories. These are all great examples of SOLID architecture and abstraction:

* [YesSQL](https://github.com/sebastienros/yessql): Stores and indexes JSON documents behind a NoSQL-like interface.
* [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore): A Content Management System (CMS) for .NET. Built on top of YesSQL.
* [Akka.NET](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net) (a .NET port of [Pekko](https://github.com/apache/pekko)): An implementation of actor-model concurrency.
* [Reqnroll](https://github.com/reqnroll/Reqnroll) (a .NET port of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs)): A test automation framework that allows developers to write tests in a human-readable `Given`/`When`/`Then` format.

### Regex

* [Regular Expressions](https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html): A comprehensive regex guide.
* [Regex Tester](https://myregextester.com/): Great for debugging and prototyping regex patterns.
* [.NET Regular Expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expressions): Official MSDN documentation of .NET-flavored regex.

### Languages I've never used for a real project, but still find interesting and worthy of study

* [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## Reading Material

### Books

* (2019) [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen

## Tech Talks

* [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/): A mathematician explains the visual intuition behind subjects that are often mathematically opaque, such as calculus, linear algebra, and large language models.
